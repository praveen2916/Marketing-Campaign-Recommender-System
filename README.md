# Marketing-Campaign-Recommender-System

This is a bank marketing campaign analysis and Recommendation system project.  In this project the goal was to classify whether a customer would subscribe to term deposit or not based on his/her charecteristics.  Upon Classification the model allows us to predict whether a new customer with given characteristics would subscribe to the term deposit or not.

In this project, statistical analysis is also carried out to derive insights on the how odds of subscibing to term deposit vary based on job type and previous loan default information.
